In this project I wish to explore possible indicators of a winning strategy. This will be observed as a whole and as groups by leagues, teams, and players. I then wish to use these indicators to compare teams and hypothesis the best team.
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
Lol_match_data_2022 <- read_csv("2022_LoL_esports_match_data_from_OraclesElixir_20220228.csv")

```
In this project I will be working with the `2022_LoL_esports_match_data_from_OraclesElixir_20220228` data provided by RIOT. The first thing needed to do is understand the way our data is constructed. I will do this by displaying a tibble of the data and a simple summary.


```{r Lol}
Lol_match_data_2022
summary(Lol_match_data_2022)
```
We are obviously working with a very large data frame. So we will begin by 

```{r find team}

```
